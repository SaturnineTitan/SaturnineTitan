ðŸ”­ Currently working on numerous projects, including physical simulations, HackerRank problems, command-line tools, and some cybersecurity goodies. 

ðŸŒ± Most of my software development learning is geared towards programming in Python and Go, but also some C/C++ development. I have experience in web development, and I'm very comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. More generally I enjoy learning about security, languages, physics, and mathematics. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I climb mountains! ðŸ—»
